## About Myself
Hello! I am a student at **Truman State University**. I am studying Mathematics + CS.  
I have pretty heavy interest in higher level mathematics â€” hence why I have made this page.

Here is my current coursework:
- MATH 451: Algebraic Structures I  
- MATH 461: Advanced Calculus I  
- CS 260: Object Oriented Programming  
- CS 333: Computer Architecture & Systems Programming

## About the Page

Here you can find all my math notes.

- I may post notes from coursework or from self-study. For example, I may posts notes on Convergence.  
- I may also post "exploration" notes. For example, I may post notes on Dual Numbers and auto differentiation.  
- I also may post about interesting problems, such as Putnam Exam Problems.


Though, what I post is not limited to these. Maybe in the future I post something more Compsci related, or maybe I might blog about a personal experience completely unrelated to anything.
