## About Me  
Hello! I’m a student at **Truman State University** studying Mathematics and Computer Science. My focus leans heavily into higher-level math, which is what motivated me to create this site.  

**Current coursework:**  
- **MATH 451:** Algebraic Structures I  
- **MATH 461:** Advanced Calculus I  
- **CS 260:** Object-Oriented Programming  
- **CS 333:** Computer Architecture & Systems Programming  

## About This Page  
This is where I share my math notes, mostly for my own reference but also for anyone else who might find them useful. Expect:  

- **Coursework notes:** From classes like Advanced Calculus or Algebraic Structures.  
- **Self-study topics:** For example, notes on dual numbers and automatic differentiation.  
- **Interesting problems:** Solutions or thoughts on problems from contests like the Putnam Exam.  

I might also post about CS topics or unrelated personal projects—this isn’t strictly limited to math.
