## Hello World!

Welcome to my very first post! This is more or less a test to see how posting works on my end.

{% raw %}
\[
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
\]
{% endraw %}

\( x^2 \)
\\( y^2 \\)

<p>Inline test: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)</p>

<p>Block test:</p>
\[ E = mc^2 \]


### Theorem. $ \sqrt{2} $ is irrational.

Proof. Suppose for a contradiction $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.
Then  $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ for some integers $p$ and $q$.
Additionally since all rational numbers have a *simplest form*,
we can assume $p$ and $q$ have no common factors.

$\implies \sqrt{2} q = p $  
$\implies 2q^2 = p^2 $

And clearly, since $p^2$ is even, so $p$ must also be even.
So, $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

$\implies 2q^2 = (2k)^2 $  
$\implies 2q^2 = 4k^2 $  
$\implies q^2 = 2k^2 $

And similarly, we see that $q^2$ is even, so $q$ must also be even.

We can see $p$ and $q$ have a common factor of $2$, giving a contradition as desired. $\square$
